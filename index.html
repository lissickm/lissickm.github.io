    <p>Integrate new technologies to help my students learn math</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I use software programs such as Geometer’s Sketchpad, Autograph, TI-Emulator and SMART Notebook to better help my students to visualize mathematics.</li>
      <li>Another component of visualization is the use of graphing calculators and computer simulations such as Wolfram Alpha in class.</li>
    </ul>
      <p>   </p>
    <p>Make available additional student supports and assistance both in-class and electronically</p>
    <ul>
      <li>My classroom website at mrlissick.com has been instrumental in the success of all my students, but especially my AP calculus students. </li>
      <li>I post a daily blog on the events in class and post additional content videos for the students to watch for help.</li>
      <li>I provide hand-written solution guides for their homework and electronic files of important documents available in the classroom.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>   </p>
    <p>Utilize data collection to inform my instruction</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I use the Senteo Response system from SMART to do formative assessments to immediately see the level of understanding of the class as a whole, or even individual students.</li>
      <li>I collect data in the form of number line plots to compare the achievement levels of groups of students from year to year on each formal assessment. The data has allowed me to better visualize how well I taught a given topic, to see if additional teaching is necessary.</li>
